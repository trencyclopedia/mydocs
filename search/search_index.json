English Blogs Markdown documentation, publish tools & workflows 14:10 Monday, December 13, 2021 I have been searching a lightweith, scablable and easy-to-use documentation method for around half a year since I finished my 150+ page-dissertation and wrote many other personal notes using Microsft Word. Previously, I searched and tried a few notetaking tools such as Roam, WorkFlowy, Evernote which didn't work out quite well for me. In fact, I sticked with Word and picked up OneNote, Notion, TheBrain to write notes, organize personal plans and projects. These tools works quite well for me at the beginning, but after I accumulated more data and records (e.g. seveal documents with 1000+ pages), Word and Notion begin to struggle with performance and scability issues. Additionally, word files and formats usually can't be coverted into html files in a straitforwad way, so another headache creeps in when I think about disseminating part of these written materials in my personal website on-line. I relize it is time to find an alternative. Initially, I tried to write light-weight documents using Markdown(md). But they were not very appealing to me immediately, because I missed some key features like table of cotents, navigation structures offered by what-you-see-is-what-you-get applications(e.g. Microsoft Word). Nonetheless, later on, when I browsed many extensive long structured documents/manuals originally written in md for open source projects, I reallized it would be a good solution to my problem too. These documents could either be hosted on-line in Github or viewed locally, and they can also be compiled as HTML files to read and share. So I fall back on md and start to learn these enabling tools for md documentation. At this moment, I am experimenting with some tools and trying to set up efficient workflows. For local documentation, I now decide to pick up Obsidian which I abodoned before. For on-line publication, I firstly try to use sphinx , it is not long before I find that MkDocs has similar functionalities but with more simpler md syntax and easier configuration. There is a more detailed article StructuredText vs. Markdown for technical documentation and reStructuredText \u548c Markdown \u8be5\u9009\u8c01\uff1f . In the following sections, I will share the most useful tips and workflows I have used so far. Markdown vs reStructuredTExt TODOs: add some comparision between makrdown and reStructuredText markdown guide reStructuredText Markdown and reStructuredText Publish md documents on Github repository using MkDocs With MkDocs, all the md documents can be viewed locally on your browser. More attractively, they can be easily pushed to your Github repository and to be viewly publicly on a website as manuals or blogs as well. These features are really fantastic! To fully benefit from this feature, firstly create a repositrory on your github account and clone it into your local computer. Starting from the local folder magic can happen soon, and you just execute the following commands or follow the instructions from mkdocs.org : * `mkdocs new .` - Create a new project. * `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server, and view it at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser * `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site. * `mkdocs gh-deploy` - upload your local documents to your remote repository on github and publish there.
